# RSNA knee: DINO + physical ALiBi

This is a reproducible test of one narrow hypothesis for the RSNA Knee MRI
abnormality-detection competition:

> Aggregating frozen DINO slice features with attention biased by **physical
> DICOM slice separation** improves scanner-grouped 12-target macro AUC over
> both mean pooling and ordinal/index ALiBi.

It is not a claim that ALiBi plus DINO is automatically leaderboard-leading.
Public work already establishes DINO as a useful baseline; report-label quality,
MRI orientation, site leakage, ensembling, and full-data retraining are at least
as important as the aggregator.  This module isolates the aggregator before
spending time on those additions.

## What is built

The pipeline is hierarchical:

1. DICOM files are ordered by the projection of `ImagePositionPatient` onto
   the slice normal from `ImageOrientationPatient`. Filename order is never
   used as geometry.
2. A fixed physical field of view is cropped. Right knees are put into a
   common orientation. Adjacent slices form a 2.5-D pseudo-RGB image.
3. A DINOv2 or DINOv3 encoder emits `CLS || mean(patch)` plus an optional
   compact spatial patch grid per slice.
4. Each pathology has its own spatial patch query, so ACL, meniscus, marrow,
   and fluid targets need not attend to the same anatomy.
5. Each series is summarized by masked mean, residual target-conditioned
   slice attention, ordinal ALiBi, or bidirectional physical-distance ALiBi.
6. A study transformer fuses all series with plane/fluid/fat-suppression
   metadata. Twelve learned target queries produce the competition logits.

The stage-two model can train a zero-initialized residual adapter in cached
DINO token space. This is substantially cheaper than repeatedly decoding the
full DICOM corpus while still testing lightweight representation adaptation. A
separate end-to-end DINO adapter is included for the final fine-tuning
experiment and has been checked against the real DINOv2-base CUDA backbone.

The feature cache makes the three aggregators use exactly the same images,
DINO features, labels, folds, and optimization budget. Optional confidence
columns weight report-derived labels, and optional report embeddings support
image/report contrastive distillation without using reports at test time.

## Data boundary

The competition data are not downloaded by this repository. Join the
competition, accept its rules yourself, and mount the files so the root contains:

```text
train.csv
train_series.csv
train_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/<SeriesInstanceUID>/*.dcm
test.csv
test_series.csv
test_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/<SeriesInstanceUID>/*.dcm
sample_submission.csv
```

Training requires a separate CSV containing `StudyInstanceUID` and all 12
target columns listed in `constants.py`. Missing values are masked. Optional
`<target>__conf` columns are confidence weights. This explicit interface keeps
weak report labels, the small expert-labeled subset, and any pseudo-labels from
being silently conflated.

Test reports are not assumed or consumed. A model that needs report text at
inference is invalid for this pipeline.

## Install and smoke test

```bash
cd experiments/rsna_knee_dino_alibi
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python smoke_test.py
python dicom_smoke.py
python stage2_smoke.py
python ensemble_smoke.py
python pipeline_smoke.py
python compliance_smoke.py
```

The smoke test is CPU-only and checks:

- permutation equivariance of physical slice attention;
- invariance to masked padding;
- sensitivity to irregular physical gaps;
- tensor-cache/collator compatibility;
- end-to-end gradient flow through both hierarchy levels.

The stage-two tests additionally check multilingual report polarity, gold-label
override, scanner-group integrity, patch and slice permutation invariance,
token-adapter training, target-wise nested OOF blending, and both ensemble
inference paths.

For a full-size synthetic workload on an ordinary CUDA GPU:

```bash
python gpu_benchmark.py --batch 8 --series 8 --slices 64 --feature-dim 1536
```

The checked RunPod RTX 4090 result is in `results/gpu_benchmark_4090.json`.
Physical ALiBi processed about 1,719 studies/s in this cached-feature inference
benchmark and peaked at 0.087 GiB allocated. These are aggregator-only numbers;
DINO encoding and DICOM I/O dominate an end-to-end run.

Validate the actual Hugging Face backbone interface separately with:

```bash
HF_HOME=/workspace/hf_cache python backbone_smoke.py --model-name facebook/dinov2-base
HF_HOME=/workspace/hf_cache python adapter_smoke.py \
  --model-name facebook/dinov2-base --local-files-only
```

The checked DINOv2-base result is in
`results/backbone_smoke_dinov2_base.json`: five synthetic images produced a
finite `[5, 1536]` `CLS || mean(patch)` tensor on the RTX 4090.
The adapter test also completed a CUDA forward/backward pass with all frozen
DINO tensors gradient-free and 51,488 adapter parameters receiving gradients;
see `results/adapter_smoke_dinov2_base.json`.

## Extract DINO features

DINOv2 is the primary backbone because its public licensing and current public
competition evidence make it the cleanest baseline. DINOv3 should be treated
as an ensemble-diversity experiment and its model-specific license checked
before redistribution.

```bash
python extract_features.py \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --split train \
  --output /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train \
  --model-name facebook/dinov2-base \
  --patch-grid 4 \
  --max-slices 64 \
  --batch-size 64

python extract_features.py \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --split test \
  --output /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/test \
  --model-name facebook/dinov2-base \
  --patch-grid 4 \
  --max-slices 64 \
  --batch-size 64
```

On an internet-disabled Kaggle inference notebook, mount the pretrained model
as a dataset and pass its local path with `--local-files-only`.

The controlled higher-resolution route trades fewer slices for more spatial
evidence, keeping backbone work near the baseline while retaining four times
as many compact patch tokens:

```bash
python extract_features.py \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --split train \
  --output /workspace/cache/dinov2-base-336-grid8-train \
  --model-name facebook/dinov2-base \
  --image-size 336 \
  --patch-grid 8 \
  --max-slices 24 \
  --batch-size 24
```

This is an ablation candidate, not a promoted default. Promotion still
requires a complete leakage-safe OOF comparison against the 224/4x4 model.

## Leakage-safe labels and folds

First freeze whole scanner groups into folds. The greedy assignment balances
the 12 observed positive masses without ever splitting a scanner group:

```bash
python folds.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train/train_cache_index.csv \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/raw_targets.csv \
  --output /workspace/labels/folded_targets.csv \
  --group-column scanner_group --folds 5 --candidate-seeds 64
```

The candidate search never sees model predictions. It selects among complete
scanner-group assignments using only expert-label class coverage and label/fold
balance, making sparse gold macro-AUC validation less likely to be undefined.

Reports are train-only privileged information. The inspectable multilingual
rule teacher produces soft targets, optional NLI scores provide an independent
channel, calibration is fitted out of fold, and expert labels always override
weak labels:

```bash
python score_reports_nli.py \
  --train-csv /workspace/labels/folded_reports.csv \
  --output /workspace/labels/report_nli.csv

python report_teacher.py \
  --train-csv /workspace/labels/folded_reports.csv \
  --nli-csv /workspace/labels/report_nli.csv \
  --output /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv
```

For the public-label escalation, combine independently published CC0 report
readers with one fixed equal-source rule. No source or target weight is fitted
on the 58 official labels; those labels are used only as exact overrides and
as an audit surface:

```bash
python consensus_labels.py \
  --train-csv /workspace/rsna-knee/train.csv \
  --folds-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --source /workspace/labels/public_llm/pilkwang/report_labels_v2.csv \
  --source /workspace/labels/public_llm/steven/llm_labels_v2.csv \
  --source /workspace/labels/public_llm/lixin/labels_llm_gpt56sol.csv \
  --output /workspace/labels/train_targets_llm_consensus.csv
```

Checkpoint selection uses only expert (`__gold`) validation entries whenever
both classes are available. Weak labels can increase training coverage but can
never make their own teacher look good in validation.

## Preregistered ablation

The restartable end-to-end training driver waits for a complete feature cache,
derives a compact summary-only cache, creates audited folds and out-of-fold
report targets, then executes the complete three-aggregator/three-seed matrix:

```bash
python run_compliant_pipeline.py
```

The compact derived cache is important: a combined patch-grid `.pt` file must
be fully deserialized even for a summary model, so deriving it once avoids
re-reading the much larger spatial tensor throughout the stage-one ablation.

Use scanner/vendor/model/field-strength groups from the generated cache index,
or supply externally audited fold assignments in the labels file. Random folds
are implemented only as a loudly marked fallback and are not evidence for
generalization.

```bash
python run_ablation.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train/train_cache_index.csv \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --output /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi \
  --seeds 2026 2027 2028 \
  --folds 5 \
  --batch-size 12

python summarize_ablation.py /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi
```

Promotion is predeclared as at least **+0.010 scanner-grouped macro AUC** for
physical ALiBi over the stronger of mean pooling and ordinal ALiBi, averaged
over complete paired fold/seed runs. Anything smaller is treated as negative or
inconclusive, not re-described as a win.

If mean pooling wins that comparison, audit its fixed all-seed OOF ensemble
without target-wise member selection:

```bash
python audit_mean_ensemble.py \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train/train_cache_index.csv \
  --runs-dir /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi \
  --output /workspace/runs/mean_ensemble_audit
```

The primary ensemble ranks each seed inside its held-out fold before averaging.
This respects the AUC objective while avoiding cross-fold logit-scale leakage.

The sequence of escalation is:

1. frozen DINOv2-base, three aggregation controls;
2. target-specific `4 x 4` patch hierarchy with a 64-wide cached token adapter;
3. DINOv2-large and an end-to-end final-block/adapter fine-tune only if stage
   two improves gold OOF AUC;
4. DINOv3 as a separately cached ensemble member, subject to its license;
5. nested target-wise OOF blend and fold ensemble for submission.

All stage-two folds are trained with:

```bash
python run_stage2.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train/train_cache_index.csv \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --output /workspace/runs/dinov2_patch \
  --aggregator physical_alibi --token-adapter-bottleneck 64 \
  --folds 5 --batch-size 8 \
  --extra --series-dropout 0.15
```

When the summary ablation promotes mean pooling, retain that winning slice
aggregation while adding only target-specific spatial patch evidence:

```bash
python run_stage2.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/train/train_cache_index.csv \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --output /workspace/runs/dinov2_patch_mean \
  --aggregator mean --token-adapter-bottleneck 0 \
  --seeds 2026 --folds 5 --batch-size 8
```

The zero-bottleneck first pass isolates spatial target pooling. Cached-token
adaptation is a separate escalation only after the spatial model improves the
same gold folds.

After all three patch seeds finish, audit the fixed family ensemble. Every
summary and patch checkpoint has equal rank weight; the audit fits neither
target-wise weights nor a model selector:

```bash
python audit_fixed_family_ensemble.py \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --summary-runs /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi \
  --patch-runs /workspace/runs/dinov2_patch_mean \
  --output /workspace/runs/fixed_family_ensemble
```

The promotion runner is fail-closed. It requires the exact preregistered
contract, all 60 fold-target cells, and the complete 30-checkpoint mean/patch
matrix before performing offline inference. It creates and validates a local
submission file but never uploads it to Kaggle:

```bash
python run_promoted_family_inference.py \
  --audit-summary /workspace/runs/fixed_family_ensemble/audit_summary.json \
  --summary-runs /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi \
  --patch-runs /workspace/runs/dinov2_patch_mean \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --dino-model /kaggle/input/dinov2-base-offline/dinov2-base \
  --work-dir /kaggle/working/fixed-family-cache \
  --output /kaggle/working/submission.csv
```

Repeat folds 0 through 4 for each promoted backbone. Do not tune on the public
leaderboard; grouped OOF validation is the model-selection surface.

## Inference

```bash
python infer.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/test/test_cache_index.csv \
  --sample-submission /workspace/rsna-knee/sample_submission.csv \
  --checkpoints /workspace/runs/dinov2_alibi/seed*/physical_alibi_fold*.pt \
  --ensemble rank \
  --output /workspace/submission.csv
```

Rank averaging is the default because the competition metric is macro AUC.

For the final internet-disabled Kaggle notebook, attach a local copy of the
public DINO model and the selected checkpoints, then use the time-budgeted
wrapper. It extracts hidden-test features inside the notebook, writes only the
required submission, and records runtime provenance:

```bash
python kaggle_offline_infer.py \
  --data-root /kaggle/input/rsna-knee-abnormality-detection \
  --dino-model /kaggle/input/dinov2-base-offline/dinov2-base \
  --checkpoint-glob '/kaggle/input/rsna-knee-checkpoints/*.pt' \
  --output /kaggle/working/submission.csv
```

See `KAGGLE_COMPLIANCE.md` and `external_assets.json` before publishing or
submitting any artifact.

For a heterogeneous ensemble, fit convex weights separately for each target
using OOF predictions, and report the nested-fold score (not the optimistic
refit score):

```bash
python fit_oof_ensemble.py \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets.csv \
  --member 'summary=/workspace/runs/base/physical_alibi_fold*_oof.csv' \
  --member 'patch=/workspace/runs/patch/patch_physical_alibi_fold*_oof.csv' \
  --output /workspace/runs/blend.json

python ensemble_infer.py \
  --cache-index /workspace/cache/dinov2-base/test/test_cache_index.csv \
  --sample-submission /workspace/rsna-knee/sample_submission.csv \
  --blend /workspace/runs/blend.json \
  --member 'summary=/workspace/runs/base/physical_alibi_fold*.pt' \
  --member 'patch=/workspace/runs/patch/patch_physical_alibi_fold*.pt' \
  --output /workspace/submission.csv
```

This is a serious leaderboard pipeline, not a guarantee of first place. The
go/no-go evidence is five-fold scanner-grouped gold OOF AUC, target-level
stability, and ensemble diversity. No architectural claim substitutes for
those measurements.

## High-resolution raw-DICOM specialists

`train_raw_mil.py` is the expensive, deliberately diverse model family. It
decodes stratified physical slices directly from the mounted DICOMs, uses 24
slices per plane for training and 32 for validation by default, fine-tunes the
last image-backbone blocks, and pools target-specific slice logits with
max-MIL. DINOv2, EfficientNet-B3, and an official-architecture RadImageNet
ResNet-50 are supported. The medical checkpoint is supplied with
`--backbone-checkpoint`; loading is rejected unless at least half of the model
state matches. Check its source license and competition eligibility before
promotion. No derived pixel cache is created.

```bash
python run_raw_mil_cv.py \
  --output /workspace/runs/raw_dino336 \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets_llm_consensus.csv \
  --backbone dinov2 \
  --model-name /workspace/hf_cache/hub/models--facebook--dinov2-base/snapshots/REV \
  --local-files-only --image-size 336 --train-slices 24 --val-slices 32
```

The fold OOF files use the schema consumed by `fit_oof_ensemble.py`. Blend
weights are fitted on the expert labels from the other folds and evaluated on
the untouched expert labels in the held-out fold; no held-out expert outcome
crosses the nested boundary.

The competitive routed variant keeps up to two series per plane and learns a
separate plane/fluid/fat-suppression bias for every target. Target-wise top-k
MIL then averages only the strongest few slice findings instead of forcing one
global slice or diluting a small lesion across an entire volume:

```bash
python embed_reports.py \
  --train-csv /workspace/rsna-knee/train.csv \
  --output /workspace/labels/report_distillation/multilingual_minilm.npz

python train_raw_mil.py \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets_llm_consensus.csv \
  --output /workspace/runs/routed --backbone efficientnet_b3 --fold 0 \
  --image-size 336 --train-slices 4 --val-slices 8 \
  --max-series-per-plane 2 --pool topk --topk 3 \
  --report-embeddings /workspace/labels/report_distillation/multilingual_minilm.npz \
  --report-weight 0.1
```

The report objective is image-to-text distillation, not test-time report use:
the model learns to predict a frozen multilingual clinical-report embedding
during training, while raw-image inference remains entirely report-free.

### Adaptive co-plane DINO pilot

The higher-capacity raw model preserves series identity and performs three
levels of target-specific aggregation: slices within a series, sequences
within an anatomical plane, and the available planes within a study. Plane
branches receive an auxiliary classification loss, and a zero-initialized
label-fusion layer can learn cross-plane/cross-diagnosis corrections without
perturbing the initial predictor. DINO adaptation uses rank-8 LoRA only in the
patch embedding and attention projections; the pretrained base stays frozen.

```bash
python train_raw_mil.py \
  --data-root /workspace/rsna-knee \
  --labels-csv /workspace/labels/train_targets_llm_consensus.csv \
  --output /workspace/runs/raw_dino336_copas_lora_pilot \
  --backbone dinov2 \
  --model-name /workspace/hf_cache/hub/models--facebook--dinov2-base/snapshots/REV \
  --external-asset-identifier facebook/dinov2-base \
  --local-files-only --architecture copas --fold 0 \
  --image-size 336 --train-slices 6 --val-slices 16 \
  --max-series-per-plane 2 --trainable-blocks 0 \
  --lora-rank 8 --lora-alpha 16 --hidden-dim 384 \
  --alibi-heads 6 --branch-loss-weight 0.25
```

This is an experimental family, not a promoted model. It must beat the fixed
scanner-grouped OOF gate and add complementary residual signal before it may
enter a submission blend. `external_asset_compliance.py` fails closed on an
unknown or blocked external asset. In particular, the public
`ytrsk/OrthoFoundation` checkpoint is recorded but blocked because its public
repository currently declares no license; the code does not treat public
downloadability as permission.

## RunPod handoff

Copy this directory to the pod, install dependencies in its persistent volume,
and run the smoke test before feature extraction. The expensive work is DINO
encoding; the cached hierarchy trains quickly on an ordinary CUDA GPU.

The current code does not accept Kaggle rules, fetch private data, submit to a
leaderboard, or claim a score that has not been measured.
