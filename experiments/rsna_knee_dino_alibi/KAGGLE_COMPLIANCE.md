# Kaggle competition compliance boundary

Audited against the official RSNA Knee Abnormality Detection rules,
evaluation, code-requirements, and competition-API metadata on 2026-08-10:

This pipeline is designed around the following hard constraints:

- hidden-test inference is image-only, internet-disabled, and time-budgeted;
- report text and the public NLI teacher are used only for training labels;
- no validation or test image is manually labeled or manually predicted;
- scanner groups never cross folds;
- weak labels never select their own checkpoints: selection uses available
  expert validation masks only;
- external pretrained assets are public and listed with licenses in
  `external_assets.json`;
- `external_asset_compliance.py` requires every external asset to declare a
  public URL, license, and eligibility decision; training and inference reject
  unknown or blocked checkpoints before reading competition images;
- the metric is macro ROC AUC over twelve targets, so the final selection and
  submission blend operate on ranks; probability calibration is not used as a
  leaderboard optimization surrogate;
- the competition is notebook-only, permits five submissions per day, and
  permits at most two selected final submissions;
- the submitted notebook must have internet disabled, finish in at most nine
  GPU hours, and write exactly `submission.csv`;
- `kaggle_offline_infer.py` validates the exact sample-submission schema,
  study order, finite probabilities, and the nine-hour notebook boundary;
- `build_kaggle_patch_kernel.py` stages a public, internet-disabled GPU kernel
  with separate public code and checkpoint datasets, and fails unless all 15
  fixed patch checkpoints are attached; building it does not publish or
  submit anything;
- competition data and derived private artifacts must not be committed or
  shared outside a team whose members have accepted the competition rules.

The three public report-label sources are CC0 Kaggle datasets. RadImageNet is
an externally pretrained model. The attached Kaggle mirror declares
CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0; the competition-specific winner-license clause explicitly
allows input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license, but the
asset must remain disclosed and independently obtainable. The source and
license distinction is recorded in `external_assets.json`; it must not be
represented as code authored by this project.

The adaptive co-plane model uses only the competition images and disclosed
pretrained weights. Its report embeddings remain a training-only teacher and
cannot enter hidden-test inference. The OrthoFoundation checkpoint is not used:
its repository is publicly downloadable but exposes no license, so the asset
manifest marks it `competition_eligible: false`. This is deliberately stricter
than treating public availability as sufficient.

On 2026-08-11 the implementation was rechecked against the 2026-08-10 official
rules audit above. Kaggle's dynamic live rules page was unavailable through
both the public API and the authenticated browser during this check, so no new
permission was inferred and every previously recorded restriction remains in
force. The official live page remains authoritative if it later differs.

The repository is public. Competition-specific code must not be pushed as a
private competitive advantage: if published, the applicable rules require it
to be made available to all competitors through the competition's associated
Kaggle forum or notebook under a permissive license. Publication and any
leaderboard submission remain explicit user actions.

This file is an engineering audit, not legal advice. The official rules remain
authoritative.
